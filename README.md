# üì∞ Fake News Classification Using ML & Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a robust text classification system to detect **fake news articles**. Utilizing both traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques, we compare multiple models to find the most effective approach. The **LSTM model** emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive **99.18% accuracy**.
